> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
I should ask the AIStudentAdvisor for suggestions on what I can work on as an AI student.
Action: AIStudentAdvisor
Action Input: "AI project ideas for beginners"
Observation: As an AI student, here are some things you can do today:
1. Explore LangChain and build a simple agent.
2. Learn prompt engineering.
3. Take a mini project using OpenAI API.
4. Watch a video on transformers or embeddings.
5. Try building a chatbot using RAG architecture.
Thought:I have some good suggestions on what I can work on today as an AI student.
Action: AIStudentAdvisor
Action Input: "AI project ideas for intermediate level"
Observation: As an AI student, here are some things you can do today:
1. Explore LangChain and build a simple agent.
2. Learn prompt engineering.
3. Take a mini project using OpenAI API.
4. Watch a video on transformers or embeddings.
5. Try building a chatbot using RAG architecture.
Thought:The suggestions seem to be the same for both beginner and intermediate levels. I should consider exploring LangChain, prompt engineering, OpenAI API projects, transformers, embeddings, and chatbots using RAG architecture.
Final Answer: I should work on exploring LangChain, prompt engineering, OpenAI API projects, transformers, embeddings, and building chatbots using RAG architecture as an AI student today.
